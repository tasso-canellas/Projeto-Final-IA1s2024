- Poster_ 
- Presentation_ 

Installation
------------
This package is part of the signal-processing and machine learning toolbox bob_. 
Install conda_ before continuing.

Download the source code of this paper and unpack it. 
Then, you can create and activate the required conda environment with the following commands::

    $ cd bob.paper.icassp2022_morph_generate
    $ conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
    $ mamba env create -f environment.yml -n bob.paper.icassp2022_morph_generate
    $ conda activate bob.paper.icassp2022_morph_generate

This will install all the required software to generate the morphing attacks.


Downloading Models
------------------
The projection process relies on several pre-existing models:

* DLIB Face Landmark detector for cropping and aligning the projected faces exactly as in FFHQ. Example_.
* StyleGAN2_ as the main face synthesis network. We fork the official repository_. The Config-F, trained on FFHQ at resolution 1024 x 1024, is employed.
* A pretrained VGG16_ model, used to compute a perceptual loss between projected and target image.


In order to download those models, one must specify the destination path of choice in the ``~/.bobrc`` file, through the following commands::

    $ bob config set sg2_morph.dlib_lmd_path /path/to/dlib/landmark/detector.dat
    $ bob config set sg2_morph.sg2_path /path/to/stylegan2/pretrained/model.pkl
    $ bob config set sg2_morph.vgg16_path /path/to/vgg16/pretrained/model.pkl

Finally, all the models can be downloaded by running::

    $ python download_models.py

Generating Morphs
------------------
**Note**: StyleGAN2 requires custom GPU-only operations, and at least 12 GB of GPU RAM. Therefore, to run all following examples and perform additional experiments, it is necessary to run this code on a GPU.

The script options can be viewed with::

    $ conda activate bob.paper.icassp2022_morph_generate
    $ python gen_morphs.py -h

The morphs of the following types of morphs can be generated at different alphas:

* OpenCV
* FaceMorpher
* StyleGAN2
* MIPGAN-II

Typical usage::

    $ python gen_morphs.py --opencv --facemorpher --stylegan2 --mipgan2 -s path/to/folder/of/images/ -l path/to/csv/of/pairs.csv -d path/to/destination/folder --latents path/to/latent/vectors --alphas 0.3 0.5 0.7

The ``pairs.csv`` file should simply be a 2 column `.csv` file **without a header** containing only the filenames of the 2 images you want to morph:

* image1.png, image2.png
* image1.png, image3.png

**Note**: Keep in mind that for the ``--stylegan2`` and ``--mipgan2`` arguments, it is necessary to have the latent vectors of all required images generated **beforehand**.

This can be done with the ``gen_latents.py``. Typical usage::

    $ python gen_latents.py -s path/to/folder/of/images/
